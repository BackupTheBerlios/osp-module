  Implemented routing and authorization validation.  The module can:
   o Request authorization and routing information from an OSP server
   o Use provided routes to:
     o Redirect the originating UI to all routes OR
     o Try all routes simultaneously using parallel forking OR
     o Try routes in the order they were received using sequential forking
   o Add and retrieve P-OSP-Auth-Token header
   o Perform local validation of the P-OSP-Auth-Token
